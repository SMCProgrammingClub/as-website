Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack of
pre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, so that they can snag
programmers and UX designers who really stand out.  Instead of spending valuable
time validating a particularly promising candidate's skillset through a
protracted series of interviews, it's often more efficient to simply __give the
individual an offer right then and there__.  Internal studies at Google have shown
that experienced recruiters can usually tell if a programmer has 'what it takes'
just from how they act at infosessions: the insightful questions they ask, the
stickers on their laptop, and how they comport themselves in general.
